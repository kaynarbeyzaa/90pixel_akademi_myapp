# Customizing the UI


#### Configuring the layout

Once the UI is created, you can pass in configuration options that change
the look and functioning of the UI bar. For example, if you wanted to not have
a seek bar, you could add the following line to the init() function from the UI
basic usage tutorial, after creating the UI overlay:

```js
const video = document.getElementById('video');
const ui = video['ui'];
const config = {
  addSeekBar: false;
};
ui.configure(config);
```

Controls will fire a {@link shaka.Controls.UIUpdatedEvent} event once the config
takes effect.
See the docs for {@link shaka.extern.UIConfiguration} for more information.

#### Customizing the number and order of controls

For example, let's say that all you care about for your app is rewinding and
fast-forwarding. You could add the following line to init(), right before
creating the UI overlay. This will configure UI to ONLY provide these two buttons:

```js
uiConfig['controlPanelElements'] = ['rewind', 'fast_forward'];
```
This call will result in the controls panel having only two elements: rewind
button and fast forward button, in that order. If the reversed order is desired,
the call should be:

```js
uiConfig['controlPanelElements'] = ['fast_forward', 'rewind'];
```
The following elements can be added to the UI bar using this configuration value:
* time_and_duration: adds an element tracking and displaying current progress of
  the presentation and the full presentation duration in the "0:10 / 1:00"
  form where "0:10" (ten seconds) is the number of seconds passed from the start of the presentation
  and "1:00" (one minute) is the presentation duration.
* play_pause: adds a button that plays/pauses the video on click.
* mute: adds a button that mutes/unmutes the video on click.
* volume: adds a volume slider.
* fullscreen: adds a button that toggles full screen mode on click.
* overflow_menu: adds a button that opens an overflow menu with additional settings
  buttons. It's content is also configurable.
* rewind: adds a button that rewinds the presentation on click; that is, it starts playing
  the presentation backwards.
* fast_forward: adds a button that fast forwards the presentation on click; that is, it
  starts playing the presentation at an increased speed
* spacer: adds a chunk of empty space between the adjacent elements.
<!-- TODO: If we add more buttons that can be put in the order this way, list them here. -->

Similarly, the 'overflowMenuButtons' configuration option can be used to control
the contents of the overflow menu.
The following buttons can be added to the overflow menu:
* captions: adds a button that controls the current text track selection (including turning it off).
  The button is visible only if the content has at least one text track.
* cast: adds a button that opens a Chromecast dialog. The button is visible only if there is
  at least one Chromecast device on the same network available for casting.
* quality: adds a button that controls enabling/disabling of abr and video resolution selection.
* language: adds a button that controls audio language selection.
* picture_in_picture: adds a button that enables/disables picture-in-picture mode on browsers
  that support it. Button is invisible on other browsers.
<!-- TODO: If we add more buttons that can be put in the order this way, list them here. -->

UI layout can be reconfigured at any point after it's been created.
Please note that custom layouts might need CSS adjustments to look good.

#### Changing seek bar progress colors
<!-- TODO: Is there a better way to do this? (The actual thing, not the tutorial) -->
The seek bar consists of three segments: past (already played part of the presentation),
future-buffered and future-unbuffered. The segments colors are set when the seek bar is created.
To customize the colors, change the values of `shaka.ui.Controls.SEEK_BAR_BASE_COLOR_` ,
`shaka.ui.Controls.SEEK_BAR_PLAYED_COLOR_`, and `shaka.ui.Controls.SEEK_BAR_BUFFERED_COLOR_` in ui/controls.js


#### Creating custom elements and adding them to the UI
It's possible to add custom application-specific buttons to the UI.
Each element has to have it's own class that implements the {@linksource shaka.extern.IUIElement}
interface and register with {@linksource shaka.ui.Controls}.
All our elements use {@linksource shaka.ui.Element} as a base class. Take a look to see if it's
right for your custom buttons.

Let's say, we want to create a button that allows user to skip the currently playing video and go to
the next one.

```js
// skipButton.js

// Use shaka.ui.Element as a base class
myapp.SkipButton = class extends shaka.ui.Element {
  constructor(parent, controls) {
    super(parent, controls);

    // The actual button that will be displayed
    this.button_ = document.createElement('button');
    this.button_.textContent = 'Skip current video';
    this.parent.appendChild(this.button_);

    // Listen for clicks on the button to start the next playback
    this.eventManager.listen(this.button_, 'click', () => {
      let nextManifest = /* Your logic to pick the next video to be played */
        myapp.getNextManifest();

      // shaka.ui.Element gives us access to the player object as member of the class
      this.player.load(nextManifest);
    });
  }
};


// Factory that will create a button at run time.
myapp.SkipButton.Factory = class {
  create(rootElement, controls) {
    return new myapp.SkipButton(rootElement, controls);
  }
};

// Register our factory with the controls, so controls can create button instances.
shaka.ui.Controls.registerElement(
  /* This name will serve as a reference to the button in the UI configuration object */ 'skip',
  new myapp.SkipButton.Factory());

```

We have our button. Let's see how we can add it to the layout.
Similar to specifying the order of shaka-provided controls, we'll need to
add a line to the init() function in myapp.js

```js
// This will add three buttons to the controls panel (in that order): shaka-provided
// rewind and fast forward button and out custom skip button, referenced by the name
// we used when registering the factory with the controls.
uiConfig['controlPanelElements'] = ['rewind', 'fast_forward', 'skip'];
```
