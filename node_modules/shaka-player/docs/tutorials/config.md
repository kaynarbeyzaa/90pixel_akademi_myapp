# Configuration

The goal of this tutorial is to introduce Shaka's configuration system and the
concepts on which it is built.  More detail can be found in the API docs.

Shaka's Player object has a hierarchical configuration.  The overall player
config contains sub-configs for various parts of the system, such as manifests,
streaming, and DRM.

To see the current config, you can use `player.getConfiguration()`.  If you run
this without setting anything first, you get the default configuration.

Player also has a `configure()` method that takes it's argument(s) in one of two
forms:

1. A plain, anonymous object.  Any fields you leave out of the config object
will retain their existing values, and any fields you explicitly set as
`undefined` will be reverted to their default value.  For example:

```js
player.configure({
  streaming: {
    bufferingGoal: 120
  }
});
```

2. For setting a single field, a name (full path) of the field can be provided
as the first argument (a string) and value of the field as the second. For
example:

```js
player.configure('streaming.bufferingGoal', 120);
```

You can use the code from {@tutorial basic-usage} and try these examples in
the JS console:

```js
player.getConfiguration();

     abr: Object
       bandwidthDowngradeTarget: 0.95

     restrictions: Object
     streaming: Object
       bufferBehind: 30
       bufferingGoal: 10
       durationBackoff: 1
       failureCallback: Function
       ignoreTextStreamFailures: false
       alwaysStreamText: false
       jumpLargeGaps: false
       rebufferingGoal: 2
       retryParameters: Object
       smallGapLimit: 0.5
       startAtSegmentBoundary: false
       safeSeekOffset: 5
     textDisplayFactory: Function


// Example configurations, all of which are arbitrary:

// set audio language preference to Canadian French:
player.configure('preferredAudioLanguage', 'fr-CA');
// NOTE: language preferences affect the next call to load()

// set text language preference to Greek and buffering goal to 2 minutes:
player.configure({
  preferredTextLanguage: 'el',
  streaming: {
    bufferingGoal: 120
  }
});

// check audio language preference, which is still Canadian French:
player.getConfiguration().preferredAudioLanguage

// check buffering goal, which is 2 minutes:
player.getConfiguration().streaming.bufferingGoal

// check rebuffering goal, which is still the default of 2 seconds:
player.getConfiguration().streaming.rebufferingGoal

// set the rebuffering goal to 15 seconds and revert buffering goal to default:
player.configure({
  streaming: {
    bufferingGoal: undefined,
    rebufferingGoal: 15
  }
});
```

Some of these fields have immediate effects (such as networking settings and
buffering settings) while some will not have any effect until the next call to
`load()` (such as DRM settings, manifest settings, and language settings).
