 *   The minimum number of seconds of content that the StreamingEngine must

 *   more of its buffers).
 * @property {number} bufferingGoal

 *   the rebuffering goal.
 * @property {number} bufferBehind
 *   The maximum number of seconds of content that the StreamingEngine will keep
 *   in buffer behind the playhead when it appends a new media segment.
 *   The StreamingEngine will evict content to meet this limit.
 * @property {boolean} ignoreTextStreamFailures
 *   If true, the player will ignore text stream failures and continue playing
 *   other streams.
 * @property {boolean} alwaysStreamText
 *   If true, always stream text tracks, regardless of whether or not they are
 *   shown.  This is necessary when using the browser's built-in controls, which
 *   are not capable of signaling display state changes back to Shaka Player.
 *   Defaults to false.
 * @property {boolean} startAtSegmentBoundary
 *   If true, adjust the start time backwards so it is at the start of a
 *   segment. This affects both explicit start times and calculated start time
 *   for live streams. This can put us further from the live edge. Defaults to
 *   false.
 * @property {number} smallGapLimit
 *   The limit (in seconds) for a gap in the media to be considered "small".
 *   Small gaps are jumped automatically without events.  Large gaps result
 *   in a Player event and can be jumped.
 * @property {boolean} jumpLargeGaps
 *   If true, jump large gaps in addition to small gaps.  The event will be
 *   raised first.  Then, if the app doesn't call preventDefault() on the event,
 *   the Player will jump the gap.  If false, then the event will be raised,
 *   but the gap will not be jumped.
 * @property {number} durationBackoff
 *   By default, we will not allow seeking to exactly the duration of a
 *   presentation.  This field is the number of seconds before duration we will
 *   seek to when the user tries to seek to or start playback at the duration.
 *   To disable this behavior, the config can be set to 0.  We recommend using
 *   the default value unless you have a good reason not to.
 * @property {boolean} forceTransmuxTS
 *   If this is true, we will transmux TS content even if not strictly necessary
 *   for the assets to be played.  Shaka Player currently only supports CEA 708
 *   captions by transmuxing, so this value is necessary for enabling them on
 *   platforms with native TS support like Edge or Chromecast.
 *   This value defaults to false.
 * @property {number} safeSeekOffset
 *   The amount of seconds that should be added when repositioning the playhead
 *   after falling out of the availability window or seek. This gives the player
 *   more time to buffer before falling outside again, but increases the forward
 *   jump in the stream skipping more content. This is helpful for lower
 *   bandwidth scenarios. Defaults to 5 if not provided.
 * @property {boolean} stallEnabled
 *   When set to |true|, the stall detector logic will run, skipping forward
 *   |stallSkip| seconds whenever the playhead stops moving for |stallThreshold|
 *   seconds.
 * @property {number} stallThreshold
 *   The maximum number of seconds that may elapse without the playhead moving
 *   (when playback is expected) before it will be labeled as a stall.
