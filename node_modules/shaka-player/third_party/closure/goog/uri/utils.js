/**
 * A regular expression for breaking a URI into its component parts.
 *
 * {@link http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt} says in Appendix B
 * As the "first-match-wins" algorithm is identical to the "greedy"
 * disambiguation method used by POSIX regular expressions, it is natural and
 * commonplace to use a regular expression for parsing the potential five
 * components of a URI reference.
 *
 * The following line is the regular expression for breaking-down a
 * well-formed URI reference into its components.
 *
 * <pre>
 * ^(([^:/?#]+):)?(//([^/?#]*))?([^?#]*)(\?([^#]*))?(#(.*))?
 *  12            3  4          5       6  7        8 9
 * </pre>
 *
 * The numbers in the second line above are only to assist readability; they
 * indicate the reference points for each subexpression (i.e., each paired
 * parenthesis). We refer to the value matched for subexpression <n> as $<n>.
 * For example, matching the above expression to
 * <pre>
 *     http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/uri/#Related
 * </pre>
 * results in the following subexpression matches:
 * <pre>
 *    $1 = http:
 *    $2 = http
 *    $3 = //www.ics.uci.edu
 *    $4 = www.ics.uci.edu
 *    $5 = /pub/ietf/uri/
 *    $6 = <undefined>
 *    $7 = <undefined>
 *    $8 = #Related
 *    $9 = Related
 * </pre>
 * where <undefined> indicates that the component is not present, as is the
 * case for the query component in the above example. Therefore, we can
 * determine the value of the five components as
 * <pre>
 *    scheme    = $2
 *    authority = $4
 *    path      = $5
 *    query     = $7
 *    fragment  = $9
 * </pre>
 *
 * The regular expression has been modified slightly to expose the
 * userInfo, domain, and port separately from the authority.
 * The modified version yields
 * <pre>
 *    $1 = http              scheme
 *    $2 = <undefined>       userInfo -\
 *    $3 = www.ics.uci.edu   domain     | authority
 *    $4 = <undefined>       port     -/
 *    $5 = /pub/ietf/uri/    path
 *    $6 = <undefined>       query without ?
 *    $7 = Related           fragment without #
 * </pre>
 * @type {!RegExp}
 * @private
