<!-- NOTE: If you ignore this template, we will send it again and ask you to fill it out anyway. -->

**Have you read the [FAQ](https://bit.ly/ShakaFAQ) and checked for duplicate open issues?**


**What version of Shaka Player are you using?**


**Can you reproduce the issue with our latest release version?**


**Can you reproduce the issue with the latest code from `master`?**


**Are you using the demo app or your own custom app?**


**If custom app, can you reproduce the issue using our demo app?**


**What browser and OS are you using?**


**For embedded devices (smart TVs, etc.), what model and firmware version are you using?**


**What are the manifest and license server URIs?**
<!-- NOTE:
  You can send the URIs to <shaka-player-issues@google.com> instead,
  but please use GitHub and the template for the rest.
  A copy of the manifest text or an attached manifest will **not** be
  enough to reproduce your issue, and we **will** ask you to send a
  URI instead.  You can copy the URI of the demo app to send us the
  exact asset, licence server, and settings you have selected there.
