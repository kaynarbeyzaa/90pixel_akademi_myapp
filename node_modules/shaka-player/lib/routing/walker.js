/**
 * The walker moves through a graph node-by-node executing asynchronous work
 * as it enters each node.
 *
 * The walker accepts requests for where it should go next. Requests are queued
 * and executed in FIFO order. If the current request can be interrupted, it
 * will be cancelled and the next request started.
 *
 * A request says "I want to change where we are going". When the walker is
 * ready to change destinations, it will resolve the request, allowing the
 * destination to differ based on the current state and not the state when
 * the request was appended.
 *
 * Example (from shaka.Player):
 *  When we unload, we need to either go to the attached or detached state based
 *  on whether or not we have a video element.
 *
 *  When we are asked to unload, we don't know what other pending requests may
 *  be ahead of us (there could be attach requests or detach requests). We need
 *  to wait until its our turn to know if:
 *    - we should go to the attach state because we have a media element
 *    - we should go to the detach state because we don't have a media element
 *
 * The walker allows the caller to specify if a route can or cannot be
 * interrupted. This is to allow potentially dependent routes to wait until
 * other routes have finished.
 *
 * Example (from shaka.Player):
 *  A request to load content depends on an attach request finishing. We don't
 *  want load request to interrupt an attach request. By marking the attach
 *  request as non-interruptible we ensure that calling load before attach
 *  finishes will work.
