## RNE Ecosystem:

React Native Elements also serves as a **platform** that connects **small teams/individuals** that needs help developing their RN app with **open source contributors** that are willing to **build complex UI screens & animated interactions** for üí∞üí∞üí∞.

Here are some of the screens that our developers have created so far:

<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row; margin-bottom: 50px">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7840686/32702785-b1d9114e-c7a0-11e7-9999-6c6a00d432ec.gif" width="280" />
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7840686/32702789-b6bbdce6-c7a0-11e7-8034-8144274fbdae.gif" width="280" />
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7840686/32702791-b947eedc-c7a0-11e7-8e8c-7dff1bd80564.gif" width="280" />
</div>
<br /><br />

If this sounds interesting and you would like to participate, kindly open a **new issue with the design & spec of the UI screen** that you need to be developed. One of our developers will respond to your issue with an estimate of time & cost. 

It's built on top of **RNE & Open Collective**. If you have any feedback or would like to know more details about this kindly contact **[Monte Thakkar](https://github.com/Monte9)**.

### Release plan:

We are currently on `v1.0.0-beta`. Since this is a beta release, any new installation of react-native-elements will get `v0.19.0`. If you would like to try out our `v1.0.0-beta` release (we highly suggest you do), run the following command:

`
yarn add react-native-elements@beta
`

Since `v1` has a lot of API changes (many of which are breaking changes due to re-written components), the `v1.0.0-beta` release is meant to give our users a heads up and give them plenty of time to migrate their apps to `v1`.

The official `v1.0.0` will be released around mid-February 2018 üéâ
